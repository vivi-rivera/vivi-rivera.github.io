- **American Government: Practices and Values**
  This course introduces students to the principles of American government. The course is divided into three parts: the foundations of politics, political institutions, and political behavior. Each of the three major parts includes readings and discussion pertaining to the critical role of race in American politics. Upon completing the class, students should be more interested and informed about the American political process; more aware of current events and how they relate to theory; more critical of political news; and more inclined to participate in elections and governance. There are no prerequisites for this course. Undergraduate students at all levels are welcome.

- **Race and Ethnicity in American Politics**
  This course introduces students to major themes in racial and ethnic politics in the United States. The course is organized into three parts. The first part reviews theories and definitions of the concepts of race and ethnicity and presents a statistical and historical snapshot of the main ethnoracial groups in the U.S. The second part focuses on the influence of racial and ethnic identities on political attitudes, political participation in such areas as elections and social movements, and political representation in legislative and party politics. The third part reviews major areas of public policy that are particularly relevant to ethnoracial minority groups, including desegregation, integration, discrimination, affirmative action, reparations, immigration, naturalization, and language.

- **Latino/a/x Politics**
  This course examines the history and contemporary role of Latinos in American politics, including the emergence of “Latino” as a pan-ethnic identity and demographic profiles of the group; the “Americanization” and “racialization” of Latinos; and the relationship between Latinos and non-Latinos as they relate to political institutions, representation, and voting coalitions. The class will also focus on the development of Latino public opinion and partisanship, how these manifest in Latinos’ political participation, and their importance in recent presidential and midterm elections (2008-2022). The course also examines U.S. immigration policy as context to understand current debates that shape the Latino community now and in the future.

- **Field Work in Government and Politics**
  The student interested in a government career is afforded the opportunity to work under supervision in a public agency or political institution. The course is designed primarily to bridge the gap between the classroom and actual employment. Each student serves as an intern in a federal, state, or municipal agency, interest group, or non-governmental agency appropriate to their major field of study.
