I am an assistant professor in the Political Science Department at Baruch College in the City University of New York. I received my Ph.D. from Columbia University and my B.A. from the University of Puerto Rico-Mayagüez. 

I specialize in American public opinion and political behavior, particularly as they relate to racial and ethnic minorities. My current work focuses on Latinos’ racial attitudes and their support for police-reform policies and the Black Lives Matter movement. I am also an Investigator on the Puerto Rico Public Opinion Lab (PR-POL), the first large-scale, nationally representative survey of Puerto Ricans on the island. My research has been funded by the Eugene M. Lang Junior Faculty Research Fellowship, the Black, Race, and Ethnic Studies Initiative (BRESI), PSC-CUNY, and Columbia’s Center on African American Politics and Society, the Division of Social Science, and the Institute for Social and Economic Research Policy. 

At Baruch, I teach courses on American Government, Race and Ethnicity in American Politics, and Latino/a/x Politics. I am also the Political Science Internship Coordinator.
