# Viviana Rivera-Burgos — Academic Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal academic website:

👉 https://www.vivianariveraburgos.com/

The site is built using Jekyll and the Academic Pages template (a fork of Minimal Mistakes) and is hosted via GitHub Pages.

## Structure
- `_pages/` — main site pages (Contact, CV, Español, Media, Research, Teaching)
- `files/` — PDFs (CV)
- `images/` — profile photo and images
